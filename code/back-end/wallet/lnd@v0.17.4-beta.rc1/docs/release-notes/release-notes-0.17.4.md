# Bug Fixes

* [Fix the removal of failed
  channels](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8406). When a pending
  channel opening was pruned from memory no more channels were able to be
  created nor accepted. This PR fixes this issue and enhances the test suite
  for this behavior.

* [Fix](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8401) an issue that
  caused memory leak for users running `lnd` with `bitcoind.rpcpolling=1`
  mode.

* [Fix](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8428) an issue for pruned
  nodes where the chain sync got lost because fetching of already pruned blocks
  from our peers was not garbage collected when the request failed.

* Let the REST proxy [skip TLS 
  verification](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/8437) when 
  connecting to the gRPC server to prevent invalid cert use when the ephemeral 
  cert (used with the  `--tlsencryptkey` flag) expires.
